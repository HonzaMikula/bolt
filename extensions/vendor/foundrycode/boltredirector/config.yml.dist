# A simple array to make variable replacements in destination paths using the

# they'll be overwritten!

# JIT (Just In Time) Replacements
#
# These replacements are made just before the actual redirect, so they
# must match any parts in `to` patterns from the above array.
#
# For conciseness, try to match an entire destination, as other URIs
# could be inadvertantly affected. If other URIs won't contain the
# string, then you can keep it as short as needed.
#
# Also, regular expressions are allowed here. Capture with \\n
